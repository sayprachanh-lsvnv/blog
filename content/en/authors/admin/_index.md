    summary: |
     I designed a mobile app in Figma from scratch, focusing on a clear UX/UI.
      I created wireframes, custom scripts, and a polished prototype with a thoughtful color scheme and user-friendly buttons.
      After testing with users, I improved the navigation and small details, such as animations. This project showed me how good design makes applications intuitive and enjoyable.
      Now I want to create an even better user experience.
