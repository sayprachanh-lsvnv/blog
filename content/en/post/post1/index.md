## What happened last week?

I had so much work that needed to be finished and submitted before the deadlines.
It felt like everything piled up at once â€” assignments, programming tasks, and random urgent matters.
I kept telling myself: "Just one more task," but before I knew it, it was already 3 a.m.

I was so focused on getting everything done that I barely slept. Coffee became my best friend,
and sleep â€” my only salvation. Still, I managed to submit everything on time, and it was a relief.

Iâ€™m trying to get my sleep back on track and maybe even take better care of myself.
Lesson learned: deadlines matter, but so does sleep!
