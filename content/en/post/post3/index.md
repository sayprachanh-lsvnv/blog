## What happened last week?

Last week was extremely intense: early morning classes, urgent homework,
and prepping for exams (why are all the deadlines always on the same day?!).
Despite the workload, I still found time for late-night gaming sessions â€” I was studying platformer mechanics after all,
that counts as learning too!

In Unity, I created a prototype of a 2D game and realized two important things:
first, the entire gameplay depends on the precision of jumps and controls, and second, testing is hard but essential.
Iâ€™m already working on improvements for the next version!
