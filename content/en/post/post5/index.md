## Last week in two words!

This week was a battle with code and a constant race against time.
I was working on a program, trying to use a library â€” turns out, itâ€™s only for x32, and I have a 64-bit system.
Urgent search for an alternative began, with the deadline just 3 days away.

Typical student life: juggling bugs, studying, and trying to get some sleep (plus a bit of gaming to stay sane).
Some days felt like a race against the clock, but what can you do â€” thatâ€™s the reality.

At least coffee exists.
