## My week \ (._.) /

I finally managed to finish some long-overdue assignments.
I gave myself a few days off â€” no tasks, just played video games all day.
Sleep was inconsistent, but Iâ€™m trying to pay more attention to it and find some balance.
Overall, last week was really relaxingâ€¦ so relaxing, it actually stressed me out a little?!
