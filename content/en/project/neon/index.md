## What is Neon?

Neon is the 3D game that I have been working for quite some times now, Neon is a pixel-based indie cyberpunk game.
In a world where the city has been captured by the AI system, the player will have to learn how to survive.
Gloomy atmosphere, stylish neons, and the struggle of a man with machines

## ðŸ”¥ Features:

- Moody pixel-art visuals with a cyberpunk soul.

- Tactical survival gameplay - think fast or get deleted ðŸ’€ .

- A haunting synthwave soundtrack that pulses with the cityâ€™s heartbeat.


*The game is still under development since I only work on it in my free time.*
