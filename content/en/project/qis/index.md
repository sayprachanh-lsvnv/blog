Qis is a custom bash shell I’m building in C.
I’m striving to make it as flexible and user-friendly as possible, both for everyday users
and seamless system interaction. A mini-tool for those who crave a little more control.

*This is a project that I have in mind for a long time, I will probably work on it during free time*
