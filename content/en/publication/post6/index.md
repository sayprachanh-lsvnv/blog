## Working with Bibliographies: A Complete Guide for Students and Researchers

Working with bibliographies is a critical stage of any academic work. Properly formatting sources not only protects against plagiarism
but also enhances the credibility of your research. Modern researchers encounter diverse source types: academic articles from Scopus and Web of Science, books,
patents, and regulatory documentsâ€”each requiring specific citation approaches.

To organize bibliographies effectively, use specialized reference managers. Zotero offers a free and simple solution,
Mendeley excels at PDF management, and EndNote suits complex projects. Group sources by topic, add annotations and tags,
and regularly back them up to cloud storage and local drives.

When formatting, adhere to your chosen citation style. GOST is used in Russian dissertations, APA in psychology and sociology, MLA in humanities.
Common mistakes include mixing styles, incomplete source data, and improper formatting of online resources. Pay special attention to academic
integrity: always credit authors, use quotation marks for direct quotes, and run plagiarism checks using detection systems.

While the focus is on bibliographies, the role of libraries cannot be overlooked. They provide access to paid databases with citation export options,
consultations for complex citation cases, and training workshops on reference managers.

Students are advised to start building bibliographies early in their studies using templates.
Researchers should regularly update literature lists and analyze the citation impact of their sources.
Mastering bibliography management ultimately saves time and lets you focus on the core content of your work.
